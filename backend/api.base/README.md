# Basic Three-Tier Application Simulation - Backend Overview

This project includes a backend built with Flask, designed to serve data through RESTful APIs. It interacts with a MariaDB database to fetch and manipulate data, which is then consumed by a Vue.js frontend.

## Backend (Flask)

The backend part of this application is developed using Flask. It is responsible for handling HTTP requests, interacting with the database, and serving data to the frontend.

### Key Features

- **RESTful API Design:** Implements RESTful APIs to handle CRUD operations on the database. CRUD refers to Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations. These operations are mapped to HTTP methods such as POST, GET, PUT, and DELETE. For example, creating a new record is done using the POST method, reading records is done using the GET method, updating records is done using the PUT method, and deleting records is done using the DELETE method.
- **Database Integration:** Utilizes Flask-SQLAlchemy for ORM and interacts with a MariaDB database. SQLAlchemy is a powerful SQL toolkit and Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library for Python. It provides a full suite of well-known enterprise-level persistence patterns, designed for efficient and high-performing database access.
- **Environment Configuration:** Manages application configuration through environment variables using `python-dotenv`.
- **Security:** Implements security measures such as CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) and secure secret key generation. CORS is a security feature that restricts web pages from making requests to a different domain than the one that served the web page. It is a critical security mechanism that protects web applications from cross-origin attacks.

### Setup Instructions

1. **Ensure Python and pip are installed:** Python and pip must be installed on your machine to set up the Flask project.

2. **Project Setup:**
   - Clone the repository and navigate to the backend directory.
   - Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install dependencies, including Flask and Flask-SQLAlchemy.

3. **Secret Key Generation:**
   - Run `python generate_secret_key.py` to generate a secure secret key.
   - Update the `FLASK_SECRET_KEY` environment variable in the `.env` file with the generated key.

4. **Running the Application:**
   - Execute `flask run` to start the Flask development server. Or simply run `python app.py`.
   - The API will be accessible through the URL provided in the terminal (usually `http://localhost:5000/`).
   - Note that the bind address is set to 0.0.0.0 in the `app.py` file, allowing the server to be accessible from other devices on the same network. This is useful for testing the API on different devices.

### Development Tips

Here are best practices and tools to enhance the application further in a professional production environment:

- **Flask CLI:** Utilize the Flask CLI for running and managing the application more efficiently.
- **Database Migrations:** Consider using Flask-Migrate for handling database migrations.
- **Testing:** Write unit tests for your API endpoints using the Flask testing framework.
- **Error Handling:** Implement comprehensive error handling for your API endpoints to provide meaningful error messages. You can use Flask's error handling mechanisms to return appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages.
- **Logging:** Use Flask's built-in logging or integrate with external logging frameworks for better monitoring and debugging. You can use tools like Sentry, Loggly, or Logstash for centralized logging. By centralizing logs, you can easily monitor and analyze the application's behavior and performance.
- **API Documentation:** Document your API endpoints using tools like Swagger or Postman. A common practice is to use the OpenAPI Specification (OAS) to define and document your API. An example of this can be found in [the docker API documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.44/). Docker uses redoc to render the OAS documentation. It's a great way to keep your API documentation up-to-date and easily accessible to other developers.
- **Security Practices:** Implement security best practices such as HTTPS, input validation, and rate limiting. You can use tools like OWASP ZAP, SonarQube, or Snyk to identify and fix security vulnerabilities in your application. You can also use security headers, content security policy, and other security measures to protect your application from common attacks.
